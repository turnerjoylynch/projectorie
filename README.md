# projectorie

Projectorie, for planning projects with simplicity.

User Scenarios:

Logan creates a board for every room in her house, and adds new ideas every time she thinks of another project to do. The kitchen has 6 already. 

Taylor has a board for each specific project, and adds every single item he’ll need for the right scope. He’s not good at math so he depends on the calculator to show him what the overall cost is without having to re-calculate himself on a post-it note he’ll lose.

Carolina doesn’t know exactly what she wants to do with her carpentry class-made dresser yet, so she’s created a board with notes detailing different directions she could go. She realizes that she doesn’t want to choose, so she creates a second project board and moves her secondary idea to the new project.
